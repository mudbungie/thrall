# thrall leak scan (bl-e878) — the disclosure half of the gate. The rest of the
# gate asks whether the tree is well-formed (fmt, clippy, the 300-line cap, the
# ast-grep rules, cargo-deny, coverage); nothing asked whether it discloses
# something. A foot runs on a machine somebody else administers and holds that
# machine's operator-issued leaf and key, an entry per workspace, a config of
# argv commands, and the captured output of everything it has run — so the
# material it could leak is exactly the material it handles: key material, host
# addresses and topology, home paths off the box, captured command output.
#
# PORTED FROM YOG (bl-e878), scanner, table, fixtures and both wirings. The
# copy is kept close to byte-identical on purpose — two copies of a disclosure
# gate drift within a week, and a short `diff` against upstream is the only
# cheap defence — and every deliberate divergence is commented where it sits.
# Ball ids in the commentary are YOG's and resolve in yog's store, not here.
#
# The rules live next door in `scripts/leak-rules.sh` and the two scopes in
# `scripts/leak-modes.sh`; this file is mechanism — HOW a file is judged, as
# against WHAT counts as a finding and WHICH files are handed over.
#
#   scripts/leak-scan.sh              scan the whole tracked tree (the gate)
#   scripts/leak-scan.sh FILE...      scan exactly these files (commit-msg)
#   scripts/leak-scan.sh --commit REV scan what REV publishes: the blobs it
#                                     adds or rewrites, plus its message
#   scripts/leak-scan.sh --self-test  prove every rule still fires, and that
#                                     none fires on the clean fixture
#                                     (the harness lives in leak-selftest.sh)
#
# THE TREE IT SCANS IS THE ONE IT IS RUN IN, WHICH NEED NOT BE THIS REPO
# (bl-1043). The rule table is resolved from the SCRIPT's own directory and the
# tree from `git rev-parse` in the working directory, so the same mechanism and
# the same table judge thrall's index and the balls TASK STORE — a different
# git repo entirely (`<state>/balls/clones/<enc>/tasks`, holding `tasks/*.md`),
# written by `bl`, never reached by this repo's pre-commit hook. Ball bodies
# are prose on a ref that publishes beside the source, and a second copy of the
# rules for them would drift from this one inside a week. Its caller there is
# `scripts/thrall-leak-gate`, the balls plugin, before the store is pushed.
#
# TWO SCOPES, BECAUSE THEY ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS (bl-1007). The tree mode
# asks "does this checkout carry a finding" — the right question for a commit
# hook (the tree IS your change) and for the workflow that judges the published
# ref. It is the WRONG question for a shared, long-lived checkout written by
# many agents: run at every store op, one polluted ball body refuses every
# agent's every op — create included, so the defect about the wedge could not
# be filed — and the author who wrote it is never the one who is told. The
# `--commit` mode asks "does this OP publish a finding", which is the author's
# own text at the moment of writing, and it is what a store gate wants.
#
# THE LATE HALF DOES NOT EXIST HERE YET, and saying so is the point. Upstream
# the standing-state question — what the store carries in TOTAL, including
# whatever predates the gate — is asked daily by a workflow over the published
# ref, where a hit's remedy (a history rewrite) belongs anyway. thrall has no
# remote and no CI: the store is founded stealth, nothing is pushed, and there
# is nothing published to scan. That workflow lands with the remote (bl-006e)
# and not before. Until then thrall has PREVENTION only, which is local and
# bypassable by whoever runs it; there is no enforcement behind it.
#
# THE TREE MODE READS INDEX BLOBS, NOT THE WORKTREE. That is the whole of
# bl-167d's headline: this scan used to enumerate `git ls-files` and then hand
# those PATH NAMES to grep, which opens the WORKTREE file — so a leak that was
# `git add`ed and then overwritten with a clean copy on disk was committed
# without the gate ever reading the bytes it was gating. `git checkout-index`
# materializes the index into a scratch directory and the scan reads that, so
# the bytes scanned are the bytes committed. The index rather than the diff,
# for the same reason `make line-cap` reads it: a diff-only gate is a sampling,
# not an invariant, and a file that leaked once and was never touched again
# would never be looked at again.
#
# THE REGRESSION HALF IS `--self-test`, and it is the point of this file. A
# leak gate does not die by being wrong; it dies by silently matching nothing
# after a pattern is edited, and then passing everything forever. So every
# rule owns a fixture (`scripts/leak-fixtures/<rule>.txt`) in which EVERY
# non-comment line must be flagged — line granularity, not file granularity,
# so one dead alternative inside a nine-way `vendor-token` pattern cannot hide
# behind the eight that still work — and must carry `FIXTURE_MARKER`, because
# no regex can tell a real secret from a fabricated one and only the value can
# say so. `rules-audit` (the ast-grep equivalent in the Makefile) only asserts
# its fixture DIRECTORY is flagged; this is the stronger check. The other
# direction is `clean.txt` / `clean-paths.txt`: near-misses that must NOT be
# flagged, because a gate that cries wolf on a fifth of the tree gets
# bypassed, and a bypassed gate is no gate.
#
# NOTHING IS EXEMPT FROM THE TREE SCAN ANY MORE. The scanner and its rule
# table used to be skipped for being made of the patterns; they are scanned,
# and stay clean because no pattern may match its own text (leak-rules.sh
# says how). A rule fixture is scanned by every rule EXCEPT the one it is the
# fixture of — its own rule must flag it, that is its contract — which is a
# structural exemption keyed to the file's own name, not an allowlist: adding
# a file to it means adding a RULE of that name.
#
# WHAT A COMMIT HOOK CANNOT PROMISE. This scans ONE TREE. Old commits, other
# refs, pull-request and release text, CI logs, build artifacts and already-
# published crate versions are all outside it, and no hook can reach them; a
# gate that implied otherwise would be worse than one that says so. They are a
# RELEASE CHECKLIST instead, and thrall's is bl-006e — the ball that adjudicates
# the remote and the first publish, which is the moment every one of those
# becomes reachable by somebody else.
#
# Known limits, stated rather than implied:
#   - IPv6 is matched in full 8-group form only. The compressed `::` forms
#     cannot be told from Rust path syntax (`deadbeef::cafe`) without a false
#     positive rate that would get the whole gate disabled.
#   - A four-part version string (major.minor.patch.build) is
#     indistinguishable from an IPv4 address. If one ever lands, it goes in
#     the rule's EXCEPT list.
#   - Ordinary prose is not detectable. A pasted paragraph of somebody's
#     conversation with no speaker label and no session key reads as writing;
#     `quoted-dialogue` catches the SHAPE transcripts arrive in, which is all
#     a regex can do.
