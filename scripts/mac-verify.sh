# mac-verify — read the macOS artifact and say what it IS.
#
#   scripts/mac-verify.sh PATH        verify one produced binary
#   scripts/mac-verify.sh --self-test verify the verifier, then nothing else
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The artifact is cross-produced on a Linux box that
# has no mac to run it on (README "The macOS artifact"). "The build succeeded"
# is therefore the whole of what the build can tell us, and it is not enough: a
# linker that quietly produced the wrong architecture, a graph that acquired a
# dependency on a dylib no stock mac carries, or a binary macOS would refuse to
# start all look identical to a green build. Every one of those is READABLE out
# of the file itself, on any platform, with no Apple tooling — this reads them.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, and it is worth being exact about the boundary:
#
#   proven    the file is a 64-bit Mach-O executable for arm64; it targets the
#             macOS platform; the minimum OS it declares; every dynamic library
#             it will ask macOS for at load time; and that it carries a code
#             signature at all.
#   NOT proven  that it runs. No mac executes it here. An artifact that passes
#             this has the shape of a working mac binary and has not been
#             observed to be one.
#
# The dylib list is the check that earns its keep. A Mach-O binary names the
# libraries it loads by absolute install path, so "does this need anything the
# operator must install first" is answerable from the bytes: every entry under
# `/usr/lib/` or `/System/Library/` ships with macOS, and anything else is a
# dependency the artifact acquired without anyone deciding to.
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS, the discipline `leak-scan` and `rules-audit` already hold in
# this repo. `--self-test` feeds the reader files it MUST refuse — a truncated
# one, a non-Mach-O one, a Mach-O for the wrong architecture, one that is not
# an executable, and one whose load commands enumerate nothing — because a
# checker that has stopped checking passes everything forever. The positive
# direction is the real artifact, which `make mac-artifact` runs immediately
# after this.
#
# BASH 3.2 AND `od`/`dd` ONLY. macOS ships bash 3.2 and always will, so there
# are no associative arrays and no `mapfile` here; and the reader must work on
# a box with no Rust, no python and no llvm — a `Makefile`, `od` and `dd`. Both
# platforms this runs on are little-endian, which is what lets `od -tu4` read a
# Mach-O 64-bit little-endian header without byte-swapping; the magic check
# below is what catches a host where that stopped being true (a big-endian host
# reads 0xfeedfacf as 0xcffaedfe and is refused as "not a 64-bit Mach-O"),
# rather than silently misreading every field after it.
